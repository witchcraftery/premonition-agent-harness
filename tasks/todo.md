# Precognitive Agent Harness Review

## Plan

- [x] Read the concept sheet, system spec, and implementation plan.
- [x] Assess the core idea for product merit, technical novelty, and risks.
- [x] Compare the plan against current agent evaluation and benchmarking practices.
- [x] Recommend clearer MVP scope, experiments, metrics, and benchmarks.
- [x] Document review results and final recommendation.

## Review

The concept has merit if framed as predictive readiness caching, not literal
precognition. The strongest MVP is QueueAhead in one support domain, measured
through offline replay against retrieval-plus-draft, semantic cache, and live
agent baselines. SceneSense remains useful as an offline evaluation sandbox, but
QueueAhead has clearer product value and benchmark fit.

Required plan changes before building:

- Move evaluation and branch-match labeling into the first phase.
- Make semantic matching a core MVP feature; exact content-hash lookup is only a
  throwaway spike.
- Define branch-match grades: exact intent, semantic equivalent, useful partial,
  miss, unsafe.
- Treat MiroFish/deep simulation as an optional ablation after a simpler branch
  generator earns its complexity.
- Add explicit baseline-to-beat sections for each product concept.
- Fix unresolved citations and malformed math formatting in the system spec.

Suggested first experiment:

- Run a two-week offline replay using 300-500 support turns or tau-bench-style
  tasks.
- Compare live agent, retrieval-plus-draft, semantic cache, prediction-only, and
  harness variants.
- Pass only if the harness improves practical readiness without safety or
  quality regression: top-3 recall around 50% or +10pp over baseline, cache-hit
  usefulness at least 70%, median time-to-useful-response at least 20% better,
  stale artifacts no more than 20%, and no critical speculative-truth leaks.
